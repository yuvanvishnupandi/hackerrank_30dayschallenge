## Challenge Details

Iâ€™m working through the HackerRank 30 Days of Code series, which is designed to improve my problem-solving skills. These challenges range from basic concepts like data types and loops to more advanced topics like recursion, binary search trees, and regular expressions.

### Problem Breakdown

Each day, I work on solving a new problem, and after completing it, I update my GitHub repository with the solution. The problems cover a wide range of topics such as:

- Data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees)
- Algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming)
- Object-oriented programming (classes, inheritance)
- Problem-solving techniques (greedy algorithms, recursion, etc.)

## Navigate

Each challenge will be added as a new file in the format `dayX.py` or `dayX.java` based on the language used. You can check out each dayâ€™s code by opening the respective file in the folder for that day's challenge.

## Contribute

If you would like to contribute to this repository, feel free to fork it and submit a pull request with your solutions or improvements.

## Conclusion

This repository is a way for me to track my progress and demonstrate my skills. Iâ€™m excited to continue learning and advancing through the 30 Days of Code series.
Letâ€™s code together! ðŸš€
